"""
You are given an array of integers stones where stones[i] represents the weight of the ith stone.

We want to run a simulation on the stones as follows:

    At each step we choose the two heaviest stones, with weight x and y and smash them togethers
    If x == y, both stones are destroyed
    If x < y, the stone of weight x is destroyed, and the stone of weight y has new weight y - x.

Continue the simulation until there is no more than one stone remaining.

Return the weight of the last remaining stone or return 0 if none remain.
